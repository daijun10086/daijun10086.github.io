### Short Bio
Hi! I'm Jun Dai, an incoming Ph.D student of [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/). Now I am working with [Prof. Tianfan Xue](https://tianfan.info/), [Porf. Jinwei Gu](https://www.gujinwei.org/), [Dr. Shi Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5hsEmuQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and all amzing people in [OpenImaging Lab](https://github.com/OpenImagingLab), focusing on Computational Photography/Imaging. My main research interests focuses on the 1. 3D Vision, ultimate goal is reconstructing a more realistic virtual world; 2. Computational Photography, trying to synthesis and capture better photograph; 3. Computational Imaging / Optics, co-design imaging systems for better vision and make invisible visible. More specific:

- 3D Reconstruction and Generation;
- Neural Rendering
- Deep Generative Models

Generally, I'm passionate about Meaningful Vision Problems, if you want to talk with me, don't hesitate to shot me an email!
